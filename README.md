# DeployManager
## A module used to help load and unload levels/part of the maps easily.

Benefits of using LevelManager:
- Automatically spawn a player once the map is loaded, save up some time
- Easily configurable levels/zones
- Helps to keep a clean code.

TO CONFIG LEVELS: 

1. You'll just need a folder in ReplicatedStorage
2. To create a level, add a folder and call it whatever you want the level name to be
3. The level must include a part named "SpawnLocation" and a Configuration named "Configuration"
4. You can split the rest how ever you would like, though make sure that every parts that makes the map are in a folder made specifically for it
You can use this image as example:
